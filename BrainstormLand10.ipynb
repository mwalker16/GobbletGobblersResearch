Using a set for canonical boards allows the use of hashing for storage of the boards, so checking if boards exist within the set is very efficient and the time it takes to search for boards is not dependent on the size of the set. This approach requires checking if all 8 symmetries of each board we encounter exist within the canonical_boards set.\n",
    "2. Using a list for canonical boards allows us to use a series of checks of symmetry for each board we encounter against each board inside of canonical_list. This approach requires using a for-loop to compare the new board to each canonical board, but the series of if, elif, else statements allow for quick checks of the 8 possible symmetries.  \n",
    "Because the canonical boards data structure will become so large due to all the possible board states, running tests to find the more efficient process will be crucial. Having this data structure will greatly reduce the computing needed when the game theory tree is created since once we create the tree for one board we can automatically \"play out\" all boards that are symmetric to that board and there will be no need to recreate that tree."
